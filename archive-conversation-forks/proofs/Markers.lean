  Two further invariants of the committed Step 2 set algebra, on top of the closure model in
  `Orphan.lean`:

  * `live_subset_keptC5`     - every live session survives to the final kept set (#3). The committed
                               code seeds `live` into the closure (`seed |= {k | k in live}`) and C5
                               only ever demotes kept-unique forks, so a live session is never moved.
  * `marker_no_hole`         - the marker decision tree has NO "~0 residue AND NOT load-bearing" cell
                               (#2): every member of `KEPT_C5 - canonicals - live` that is not
                               load-bearing has nonzero residue, so it cannot fall through the deleted
                               branch. (Round-5 Q4, previously fuzz-only; here machine-checked.)

  This needs the ENRICHED model: the pre-re-close seed `KEPT0` is decomposed into its three real
  sources `canonicals ∪ live ∪ kuf` (kept-unique forks), so the closure-inversion can place a
  non-canonical, non-live, non-load-bearing member into `kuf` and invoke C5's demotion contract.
  The abstract `no_orphan` in `Orphan.lean` is undisturbed - it stays generic over `KEPT0`.

  The enriched seed: `KEPT0 = canonicals ∪ live ∪ kuf`. Matches the committed
  `KEPT = canonicals | set(locked) | kept_unique_forks` at the point the re-close starts
  (the preliminary `locked` is itself the closure of `canonicals ∪ live`, so it folds back in).

/--
  CLOSURE INVERSION (the key step in marker-no-hole). A closure member that is NOT in the seed must
  have entered via the `cross` or `phan` edge, and BOTH land in `loadbearing`. So a non-seed member
  is load-bearing. (Proof: `cases` on the derivation; the `seed` case contradicts non-membership.)

  `cross_lb` / `phan_lb` are the committed `loadbearing` definition restricted to closure members:
  loadbearing collects cross-file targets of consumers and sources of needed phantoms, and the
  closure only ever follows exactly those two edges, with the consumer being a prior closure member
  (`consumers = KEPT | live ⊇ closure`).

  #3 - LIVE SURVIVES. Every live session is in the final kept set `KEPT_C5`.

  `live_seeded`    : the code seeds live into the closure (`seed |= {k | k in live}`), so a live
                     session is in `KEPT_final` by the `seed` constructor (here: live ⊆ seed0).
  `live_not_demoted` : C5's demotion loop ranges over `kept_unique_forks` only; a live session is
                     not a kept-unique fork, so it is never demoted. (In the code, live and kuf are
                     disjoint: live comes from the registry, kuf from the per-tree fork judgment.)

/--
  #2 - MARKER NO-HOLE. For every member `x` of `KEPT_C5 - canonicals - live`, either `x` is
  load-bearing OR `x` has nonzero residue. Equivalently: there is NO `x` in that range that is
  simultaneously `~0 residue` AND `not load-bearing` - the branch deleted from the marker tree is
  unreachable, so the tree is exhaustive over its range.

  `residue x` abstracts the committed `residue = set(fps[k]) - ⋃_{j∈KEPT, j≠k} fps[j]` as the set of
  globally-unique messages of `x`; "nonzero residue" is `∃ m, residue x m`.

  Hypotheses (each a committed-code fact):
  * `cross_lb`, `phan_lb`  : the loadbearing-from-closure facts (see `nonseed_loadbearing`); the
                             cross-file target / phantom source of a closure member is load-bearing.
  * `C5_survivor`          : C5's actual postcondition. C5 demotes a kept-unique fork iff
                             (not load-bearing AND exactly-0 residue), so a SURVIVING kuf is
                             load-bearing OR has nonzero residue. Passing this disjunction directly
                             (rather than "not load-bearing -> residue") keeps the proof constructive:
                             no need to decide `loadbearing x`.

  FULLY CONSTRUCTIVE. The proof is a direct `cases` on the closure derivation (`seed` / `cross` /
  `phan`), so it needs neither `Classical.em` nor any decidability instance: it depends on NO axioms.
  (The `seed` case splits the `canonicals ∨ live ∨ kuf` disjunction the seed already carries; the
  `cross` / `phan` cases hand back load-bearing directly. This inlines `nonseed_loadbearing`.)

  FULLY-WIRED capstones: the marker / live theorems stated over the FixProto-DEFINED `loadbearing`
  and `demoted` (their actual committed set definitions), with the `cross_lb` / `phan_lb` /
  `live_not_demoted` / `C5_survivor` hypotheses DISCHARGED internally via the `FixProto.*_from_def`
  lemmas. So nothing about loadbearing/demoted is assumed here; the only inputs are the seed
