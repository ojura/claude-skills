  No-orphan invariant for the archive-conversation-forks Step-2 set algebra (SKILL.md).

  Models the committed keep-locked closure + C4 re-close + C5 demotion + C6 deferred archive,
  and proves that archiving never orphans a kept session's phantom-backfill origin.

  Pure Lean 4 core (no mathlib): sets are predicates `File → Prop`; the keep-locked
  closure is an INDUCTIVE predicate, so "closed under the closure rules" is definitional
  and the least-fixpoint/induction principle is free from the recursor.

  MAIN RESULT (no orphan): for every store and every operator `judge` policy, every needed phantom of a
  finally-kept file that has ANY source in the store retains a source in the finally-kept set.

  The keep-locked closure of a seed set `S`, as a least fixpoint via an inductive predicate.

  Parameters abstract the two structural edge types and the source-choice:
  * `cross k b`     : `k` references (via lpu) a uuid that `b` owns  (cross-file ancestor edge).
  * `needs f P`     : file `f` has a root phantom boundary for phantom `P` (relies on a sibling).
  * `sources s P`   : file `s` can backfill phantom `P` (has pre-content before that boundary).
  * `pick P`        : the source the closure REALISES for phantom `P`. NOT necessarily the literal
                      `max(srcs, key=len(set(fingerprints[s])))` richest source: the committed `locked_closure`
                      adds `best=richest` only via `if not (set(srcs)&locked)`, i.e. only when no source
                      of `P` is already locked (e.g. via a cross-file edge). So the realised kept source
                      can be a DIFFERENT source than the richest. `pick P` abstracts the witness the closure instantiates:
                      the source `locked_closure` leaves in `locked` for `P` at fixpoint. Its existence
                      (a source of `P` is in `locked` whenever `P` is a needed phantom of a locked file
                      with >=1 source) is the closure's fixpoint guarantee, verified by fuzz over the
                      committed code; `hpick` below is exactly its defining contract.

  The three constructors are exactly `locked_closure`:
  (seed)  every seed member is in;
  (cross) if `k` is in and `cross k b`, then `b` is in;
  (phan)  if `f` is in, `f needs P`, and `P` has a source, then the realised source `pick P` is in.
          (This is sound precisely because, at fixpoint, the committed code keeps SOME source of `P` in
          `locked`; we name that realised source `pick P`. The model is faithful to the existential the
          code guarantees, NOT to the over-specific claim "the richest source is locked".)

  STEP 1 - closure property. The closure of `S` is CLOSED under needs→source, given the
  choice-function contract `hpick` ("the realised source `pick P` IS a source of `P` when one exists").
  `hpick` is the abstract form of the committed code's fixpoint guarantee: whenever `P` is a needed
  phantom (of a locked file) with at least one source in the store, `locked_closure` leaves some source
  of `P` in `locked`; `pick P` names that realised source. The proof quantifies over EVERY `pick`
  satisfying `hpick` (the proof never uses "richest"), so it covers the committed code's realised choice
  regardless of which source the `if not (set(srcs)&locked)` branch happens to keep.
  This is the only place the closure's `phan` constructor is used; everything downstream is set bookkeeping.

  The patched pipeline produces a chain of kept sets:

    KEPT_final  x   := Closure cross needs sources pick KEPT0 x              -- C4 `locked=closure(KEPT); KEPT|=locked`

  We carry `loadbearing` and `demoted` as predicates with the two facts the patched code guarantees:
    (G1) demoted_guard : demoted k → ¬ loadbearing k        -- C5's `if k in loadbearing: continue`
    (G2) source_loadbearing : a file that sources a NEEDED phantom is loadbearing
                              (loadbearing |= {s | sources s & needed}); here a phantom is
                              "needed" because some KEPT_C5 (hence consumer) file needs it.

  STEP 3 - C5 safety (Q3): a file that sources a phantom NEEDED by a surviving kept file is
  never demoted by C5. This is the load-bearing guard made explicit: such a source is
  load-bearing (`source_lb`), and C5 demotes only non-load-bearing files (`demoted_guard`),
  so the source survives. The main result reuses this step.

  MAIN THEOREM (no orphan), over the FINAL kept set after C4 re-close + C5 demotion + C6 archive.

  Hypotheses (each a fact the committed code establishes; see SKILL.md Step 2):
  * `hpick`            : the realised source `pick P` is an actual source of `P` when one exists. This is
                         the committed `locked_closure` fixpoint guarantee ("some source of a needed
                         phantom stays in `locked`"), NOT the over-specific "richest source is locked"
                         (the `if not (set(srcs)&locked)` branch can keep a different source). The proof
                         is generic over any `pick` meeting this contract.
  * `demoted_guard`    : C5 demotes only non-loadbearing files (`if k in loadbearing: continue`).
  * `source_lb`        : any file that sources phantom `P`, when `P` is needed by a kept-and-surviving
                         file, is load-bearing (`loadbearing |= {s | sources s & needed}`, with
                         `needed = ⋃ needs(consumers)` and `consumers = KEPT | live ⊇ KEPT_C5`).

  Conclusion: every needed phantom `P` of a surviving kept file `f`, if `P` has ANY source in the
  store, retains a source `s` that is ALSO in the surviving kept set `KEPT_C5`.

  NOTE on C6: C6 archives only members of `tree_archive_candidates - KEPT_C5`, i.e. files NOT in
  `KEPT_C5`. It therefore cannot remove any member of `KEPT_C5`, so `KEPT_done = KEPT_C5` for the
  purposes of membership, and the theorem about `KEPT_C5` IS the theorem about the final picker set.

  ============================================================================================
  RECALL-PASS NO-LOSS (the second archive path's safety property).

  `no_orphan` above guarantees the STRUCTURAL safety of archiving: a kept session's needed
  phantom always keeps a source. The recall pass archives on a DIFFERENT criterion - exact
  content redundancy - so it needs its own safety theorem: archiving a 0-unique candidate
  loses no message. Messages are opaque here (`fingerprints f m` = "file `f` carries message-fingerprint
  `m`"); this is a separate, content-level layer from the structural closure above.

def preserved {Msg : Type} (fingerprints : File → Msg → Prop) (KEPT : FSet File) (A : File) : Prop :=
  ∀ m, fingerprints A m → ∃ b, KEPT b ∧ fingerprints b m

/--
  The recall pass's `missing` set: messages of `A` not found in any kept file. The committed code
  computes `missing = set(fingerprints[A]) - kept_union` and archives `A` iff `missing` is empty.

def missing {Msg : Type} (fingerprints : File → Msg → Prop) (KEPT : FSet File) (A : File) : Msg → Prop :=
  fun m => fingerprints A m ∧ ¬ ∃ b, KEPT b ∧ fingerprints b m

/--
  RECALL NO-LOSS. If the recall test passes (`missing A` is empty: every message of `A` is in some
  kept file), then archiving `A` preserves all of `A`'s content. The hypothesis `hempty` is exactly
  the committed code's `if not missing` test stated set-theoretically, so this certifies that the
  0-unique archive decision loses nothing - the content-level counterpart of `no_orphan`'s structural
  guarantee. `A`'s own membership is irrelevant: the witness `b` may be any kept file (the code's
  "split-contained across several kept files" case is covered, since `b` is existentially quantified
  per message, not a single container).

  FULLY CONSTRUCTIVE. "m lives in some kept file" is `Decidable` (the committed code computes it as a
  Python `in` against the kept-union set), so the case-split is `Decidable`, NOT classical: this
  theorem depends on NO axioms. The decidability instance is the faithful counterpart of the set
  membership the code actually evaluates.

  CONTENT SAFETY UNDER DEBRIS REMOVAL (the recall∘debris / C5∘debris fix, made first-class).

  `recall_no_loss` above is stated over a FIXED `KEPT`. The committed pipeline removes files from
  the picker on FOUR paths, and the Step-2 DEBRIS nomination is the fourth: it discards files from
  KEPT. If a content pass (the recall pass, or C5 demotion) measured containment against a KEPT that
  STILL held debris, a debris shell could be the sole container that makes another file read
  "redundant"; archiving both then strands a message. The fix is a USAGE-SITE one: discard debris
  from KEPT BEFORE the content passes measure containment, i.e. apply these theorems at the
  post-debris kept set. The theorems below make that ordering explicit and give the C5 path its own
  content guarantee, so the composition is checked, not assumed.
  ============================================================================================
-/

/-- RESIDUE as the committed set-difference: `residueOf x m` holds iff `x` carries `m` and NO OTHER kept
    file does (`fingerprints[x] - ⋃_{j∈KEPT, j≠x} fingerprints[j]`). This is what the marker loop and the
    C5 demotion measure. (Named `residueOf`, not `residue`, to avoid shadowing the abstract `residue`

/-- RESIDUE MONOTONICITY - the debris-discard direction, which refutes the "shrink the residue" worry.
    Removing files from KEPT (discarding debris) drops them from the SUBTRACTED union, so residue can only
    GROW: a residue message against the larger KEPT is still a residue message against any subset KEPT'.

/-- Corollary for marker faithfulness: a file with NONZERO residue against the larger (with-debris) KEPT
    still has nonzero residue against KEPT∖debris. So the marker loop's `loadbearing ∨ ∃ residue` disjunct,
    measured over the post-debris KEPT, is implied by the same fact over the with-debris KEPT - discarding
    debris before the marker loop cannot reopen the `~0-residue ∧ ¬loadbearing` hole `marker_no_hole` closes. -/

/-- RECALL no-loss over the FINAL (post-debris) picker. The recall pass must compute `missing` over KEPT
    AFTER debris is discarded; then a passing (`missing = ∅`) test guarantees every message of the archived
    candidate lives in a kept file that SURVIVES debris removal, so a later debris move cannot strand it.
    This is `recall_no_loss` applied at the post-debris kept set - the bug was a usage-site error (measuring
    over a KEPT that still held debris), not a flaw in `recall_no_loss`. -/
